# My link site

I built this site because I wanted to build a repository where I can gather the links I like in one place.
To post new links, get existing links, update what is already there now, in short a server that will manage the Backend and a Frontend site that will pull all the sites through an API and display everything to the screen.

I set up an express mini-server written in node.js (because I removed all the options except GET), uploaded it to the railway website.

For database I use Monge atlas.

This site loads all the data into one place, arranges everything by categories and displays everything.
It's a content site that simply displays all the links in one place, every time the site is loaded it pulls all the links using the same API.

## Links
API - [https://my-link-server-production.up.railway.app/my-links/all](https://my-link-server-production.up.railway.app/my-links/all)
